# React for Accessibility

This project is a small React app focused on building basic accessible components. It includes a SkipToContent link, Header, Top Navigation, Footer, and simple UI elements like Button, Label, TextBox, and Anchor. The goal is to create a minimal component library that follows good accessibility practices and is easy to understand.

## Features

- SkipToContent link placed at the top for keyboard navigation
- Header and TopNav layout structure
- Accessible Button component with proper labeling
- Accessible Label component tied to form inputs
- TextBox input with clear styling and keyboard focus behavior
- Anchor component with proper target and rel handling
- Simple layout structure that keeps content readable

## Tech

- React with Vite
- CSS modules for component-level styles
